Rank of a random matrix on finite field.
Randomized Algoriths - Randomize stuff in the professor's thesis, Monte Carlo Simulations
Probablistic analysis of Algortithms - Proffesor's open problem. Maybe analyse that problem in randomized fashion. Also, If the matrix is given in analytical form can it be analysed in probablistic fashion.
